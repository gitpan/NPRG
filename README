NPRG & Wingraph
---------------

This package contains two modules for creating and printing reports
using Windows GDI and printer support.
See documentation in .pod format in appropriate modules.
You also need Alias module, available from CPAN.

Installation is standart:

perl Makefile.PL
nmake
nmake install

Unfortunaly I don't seems any ways to create tests for this module.
Edit example.pl file (enter you printer name) and try to run
it. You must get tsta,emf file.

This modules was tested under ActiveState Perl 5.6.0 distribution and
under original Perl source distribution using
Microsoft Visual C++ Version 12.00.8168 for 80x86.
It seem that you do not encounter with 5.5.x versions of Perl
and under earlier versions of MSVC++.
